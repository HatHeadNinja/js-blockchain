## A Story of a Tool and a Rabbit Hole
I use Quokka, which is an awesome inline real-time JS evaluation tool, allowing me see variable values right in the IDE in real time without having to console.log out.

However, after some hours, I discovered Quokka updates use both Date.now() and Math.random().

## Next Steps
Going to take this code and create a React front-end, with Jest tests and Storybook.
